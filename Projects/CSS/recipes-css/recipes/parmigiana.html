    <p><i>Eggplant parmigiana or eggplant Parmesan is one of the most popular and iconic vegetarian<br/> Italian dishes and this recipe is straight from Italy. Use ripe eggplant without seeds and salt them for 1 hour to remove the bitterness.</i></p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr/>
    <ul>
     <li>3 pounds large eggplants, sliced lengthwise into 1/4-inch slices</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons coarse salt, or as needed</li>
     <li>5 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons flour for dredging</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr/>
    <ol>
      <li>Place a single layer of eggplant slices in a colander sitting on a plate and sprinkle with coarse salt. Cover with a second layer and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining eggplant. Place a plate on top and add a weight to put pressure on the eggplant slices. Let stand at room temperature for about 1 hour. </li>
      <li>Rinse eggplant slices under running cold water to wash off all the salt. Pat dry on all sides with paper towels. </li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep skillet over medium-high heat. Dredge eggplant slices in flour on both sides and add to the hot oil, working in batches. Deep fry eggplant until golden, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels. </li>
      <li> Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook garlic and onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomato puree, 4 basil leaves, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until sauce starts to thicken, about 20 minutes. Remove sauce from heat. Discard garlic and stir in remaining 4 leaves basil.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
      <li>Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the bottom of a baking dish. Cover with a single layer of eggplant slices. Top with more sauce, mozzarella slices, and Parmesan cheese. Continue making layers, a total of 3 to 5, finishing with tomato sauce and grated Parmesan cheese. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and bubbling, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 20 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
